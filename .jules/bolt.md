## 2024-05-24 - [Avoid full directory context upload for Docker builds]
**Learning:** Sending the full directory context during a `docker build` can be a huge performance bottleneck. If a script creates a Dockerfile dynamically and uses `COPY` or `ADD` from the host context, Docker needs that full context upload. However, if the Dockerfile doesn't copy local files, it's better to bypass this context upload completely by piping the Dockerfile to `docker build` via stdin (using `docker build - < Dockerfile`).
**Action:** Always check if a Dockerfile uses host context via `COPY` or `ADD`. If it doesn't, pipe the Dockerfile directly to stdin to save a significant amount of build time, especially in large directories.

## 2024-10-18 - [Avoid useless cat pipes in loops]
**Learning:** Using a `cat file | cmd` pipe inside a loop spawns unnecessary subshells and processes for `cat` in every iteration, causing measurable overhead.
**Action:** Always use input redirection (`cmd < file`) instead of piping `cat` output, especially inside loops, to optimize shell script execution.
## 2024-11-09 - [Avoid unnecessary temp file I/O with heredocs]
**Learning:** Creating a temporary file just to store a Dockerfile string and pass it to `docker build - < file` involves unnecessary disk I/O and process spawning (`mktemp`, `rm`).
**Action:** When a Dockerfile is statically defined in a shell script, pass it directly to `docker build -` using a heredoc (`<<'EOF'`) to improve script execution speed and simplify code.
